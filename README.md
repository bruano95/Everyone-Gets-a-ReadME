  ## DESCRIPTION
  ### This command line application allows users to easily generate a professional README file. The user can enter desired text and the application will use these inputs to create an original file. The user can then use this README within their current project. A good README file is an important part to every coding project. It allows for the users to better understand the project while learning how to properly use the application, the contributors, and ways to reach the developer.

  ## INSTALLATION
  ### In order to use this application the user must have a working computer and have VScode downloaded. The user will then git clone the repo onto their computer. Following this, the user will now  git clone the repo to the local system. Users will now install the inquirer npm package. 

  ## USAGE
  ### After all of the above installation instructions are completed, the user can now run the application using 'node index.js'. The user is then prompted with questions within the command-line. After answering all of the questions, if answered correctly the user will be shown the word "success!". A professional ReadME file is then generated into a file and the user can now import it into their own ReadME. Here is a link to a walkthrough video of how a user is to use this application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oSJXkUe3DfNi3pVVg-X9SC7OhWDRH0IH/view?usp=sharing
